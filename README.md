## Data Analysis Questions
Microsoft Office Excel and MapBox will be used to conduct a cluster analysis, time series analysis, and geospatial analysis to answer the following data questions:
1. How can Baltimore water stations be organized into clusters based on the presence of nitrate/nitrite/nitrogen levels?


## Data Answer 1
### How can Baltimore water stations be organized into clusters based on the presence of nitrate/nitrite/nitrogen levels?

The Microsoft Office Excel Solver tool was used to identify three clusters representing the data. The water stations were grouped based on the calculated z-scores for the presense of nitrate/nitrite/nitrogen in each water station. Cluster 1 consists of nitrate/nitrite/nitrogen levels that are below average in relation to the other stations; there are 17 stations in this cluster, and the cluster node is Warner and Alluvion. Cluster 2 is defined by the stations that have z-scores that are close to zero, indicating that the nitrate/nitrite/nitrogen levels are around average in relation to other stations; there are 20 stations in this cluster, and the cluster node is Stony Run. Finally, Cluster 3 is defined as the stations which have above average nitrate/nitrite/nitrogen levels in relation to the other stations; there is only one station in this cluster, the cluster node, Lombard St.  It is important to note that the characteristics described for each cluster are the exact characteristics of the cluster nodes which represent each cluster. All station within each cluster do not always share the exact same characteristics.
